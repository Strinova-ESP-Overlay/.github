## 🧭 Overview

Instead of reacting late, ESP overlays reveal threats and opportunities before they reach you. Configure filters to highlight only what matters: rival players, NPCs, rare resources, or strategic points of interest. Clean rendering keeps your screen clear while giving you critical data in the heat of combat.

## ⭐ Features

* **Enemy ESP** – Outline rival players and NPCs through walls and terrain.
* **Loot & Resource Highlights** – Track rare drops, crafting mats, or supply crates.
* **Objective Awareness** – Mark capture points and dungeon targets.
* **Distance Scaling** – Fade distant overlays for clarity.
* **Customizable Filters** – Choose which categories appear on-screen.

[!WARNING]
Activating too many overlay filters may clutter your HUD—use balanced presets for best visibility.
